#loopover_android
The game "Loopover" by carykh made in Processing for android

Buttons: 

's': shuffle the board

'r': reset the board

'+': increase the board size

'-': decrease the board size

The program was made for local training of the game; it creates the files "highscores_n.txt" and "attempts_n.txt", where 'n' is the ammount of rows of the board. The files keep track of your highscore history and your other attempts. Only required time, date and time are saved, not the initial board or the moves made to solve it.
